### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm b1uejay27 (though I also go by Jay) and I'm a high school student and programmer from the United States who's interested in pretty much anything to do with technology and birds. I'm currently exploring the worlds of software development, though I'm also very interested in exploring web development, graphic design, IT, networking, and cybersecurity. I primairly program in Python, though I've been working towards learning and hacking things in Rust, Go, and TypeScript. You can reach out to me on Discord at `b1uejay27#5141` or through email at `hello@b1uejay27.tech`. Oh, and I also go by `he/they` pronouns. I hope to see you around!
